              <h2>Design</h2>
              <p>Whether architecting new applications or improving upon what you already have, I am here to help to
                  design a stable, modern, and maintainable system that'll last for years to come.</p>
          </b-col>
          <b-col class="feature">
              <h2>Develop</h2>
              <p>I practice clean code, SOLID, and TDD. You can be assured that all code developed for your application
                  will be robust and secure.</p>

          <b-col class="feature">
              <h2>Maintain</h2>
              <p>Even computers need a little oil. If you have legacy code but no one understands it, I can help
                  make sense of your old software and add those delayed, needed features.</p>

              <h2>DevOps</h2>
              <p>DevOps is a concept more than a practice. Every company is different and I can help understand your
                  business and develop your next automated SDLC workflow to get your projects back on track.</p>

              <h2>Data</h2>
              <p>You can't have a useful application without a database supporting it. I know many different DB
                  management systems and can use your big data appropriately. Whether integrating a database or building
                  a new one, no database is too difficult.</p>

              <h2>Training</h2>
              <p>IT is hard. Learning IT is harder. Let me help train your staff on a new piece of software, a new
                  process, or Agile development.</p>
